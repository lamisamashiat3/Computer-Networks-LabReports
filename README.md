This Git repository is dedicated to storing the lab reports for the Course-
CSE-3634_Computer Networks Lab.

Lab 1 to Lab 6:
These labs are based on simulations and exercises completed using Omnet++, a discrete event simulation environment. Each lab report is structured to cover the theoretical concepts, simulation setup, results, and analysis related to various networking scenarios.

Lab 8 to Lab 10:
These labs involve practical networking exercises accomplished using GNS3, a network emulator. The reports for these labs detail the configurations, implementations, and analysis of different networking setups as required in the course curriculum.
